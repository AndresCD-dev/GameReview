#reviews
r1 = Review.create(score: 10, time: 2.months.ago, user_id: u1.id, game_id: g1.id, content: "Even if you're specifically looking for it, it's hard to find fault in Ocarina of Time. OK, to be fair, there's a slight bit of slowdown in a couple locations, such as the water temple, but it isn't frequent or harmful enough to even matter. The game offers a nice challenge, a stunningly well-told story, and the gameplay to back it all up. This game is the real thing. This is the masterpiece that people will still be talking about ten years down the road. This is the game that perfectly exhibits the quality not quantity mantra that Nintendo has been touting since the N64 was released. In a word, perfect. To call it anything else would be a bald-faced lie.")
r2 = Review.create(score: 8, time: 1.months.ago, user_id: u1.id, game_id: g2.id, content: "For all its minor shortcomings, Wii Sports pretty much encapsulates exactly what a launch title should be. It shows off the merits of the Wiiâ€™s impressive controller brilliantly and does so in a way which is almost unfathomably entertaining. What's more, itâ€™s no exaggeration to say that the game's managed to captivate even the most ardent videogames haters we know after a few futile moments of resistance, and that's exactly as it should be. Ultimately, we don't really need to tell you if the game's any good - you're going to end up with a copy whether you like it or not. What we will say though is: put away any prejudices you might be harbouring against Wii Sports. Simply, it's probably the most fun you and a bunch of friends are going to have around a console this Christmas. And you might even get your granny to join in too.")
r3 = Review.create(score: 9, time: 3.months.ago, user_id: u1.id, game_id: g3.id, content: "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate lives up to its name, offering the most comprehensive game in the series to date. It has an absurd amount to play, fight, and unlock â€“ though that can be to its detriment at times. While the World of Light adventure mode isnâ€™t reason alone to get Smash Bros., itâ€™s still a consistently amusing and shockingly large campaign, and a worthy compliment to Ultimateâ€™s incredible multiplayer core. The Smash Bros. series has always maintained a wonderful balance of chaotic beat-em-up fun and tense fighting game action, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate refines and improves on both sides of itself without abandoning either one.")
r4 = Review.create(score: 10, time: 4.months.ago, user_id: u1.id, game_id: g4.id, content: "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. Iâ€™ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after Iâ€™ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I havenâ€™t seen before. Iâ€™ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.")
r5 = Review.create(score: 9, time: 2.months.ago, user_id: u2.id, game_id: g5.id, content: "Mario Kart 8 is the best kart racing game Nintendo has made in a long time. It strikes a careful balance between refining old ideas while introducing fresh new ones. Admittedly, its gorgeous graphics and jazzy orchestrated soundtrack bolster its presentation, but youâ€™re getting a lot more than just looks with this one â€“ although I spent an awful lot of time gawking at the details in slow-motion, the fast and furious pace of racing with friends both locally and online is what really kept me coming back.")
r6 = Review.create(score: 10, time: 1.months.ago, user_id: u2.id, game_id: g6.id, content: "Nintendo 64's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team. Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise. 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there's never a dull moment. Secrets play a huge part of the experience, recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series. In fact, this game is exactly as one might hope it would be: Mario in 3D. More freedom, more space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control schemes -- it's all there. Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever. Don't rent. Buy.")
r7 = Review.create(score: 9, time: 2.months.ago, user_id: u2.id, game_id: g7.id, content: "This is my favorite single-player GameCube title to date. It's completely captivating from the start, and I can't rave enough about the tight controls. It just feels right. However, I am quite disappointed by the vacation theme and Nintendo's stubborness to pay attention to presentation. The story and character design especially is poorly executed. I think Nintendo finds making Peach into a total ditz and Mario into a fat goon amusing, but it feels pretty lame for those of us with some intelligence. If Nintendo truly didn't care about the story, then it shouldn't have even bothered to offer up the poorly done, compressed FMV sequences. At the end of the day, though, Super Mario Sunshine is about gameplay. Its depth easily passes by all of the problems with presentation, sound, and visuals. If Super Mario 64 is one of your favorite games, then I'm confident Super Mario Sunshine will be added to that list. Gamers looking for a good adventure cannot go wrong.")
r8 = Review.create(score: 9, time: 4.months.ago, user_id: u2.id, game_id: g8.id, content: "I'm glad Nintendo is courageous enough to bring a game like Animal Crossing to an international audience. The last time the company did something like this, we ended up with Pokemon. While Animal Crossing may have a harder time appealing to older gamers because of the recent rise in popularity by M-rated games, it's most likely going to be word of mouth that will make this game a success. I hope my word helps out at the start of it all: Get this game. If you're all about action and exploration games, then Animal Crossing may be an acquired taste at first. Just like turn-based RPGs were considered too niche and tedious on Game Boy before Pokemon, Animal Crossing will hook you once you get past its quirky presentation and slower-paced gameplay. But if you're the kind of person who is willing to take chances and explore new game genres, this could turn into one of the most rewarding titles you've ever picked up. And if you're a Nintendo fan, there's just no way around it -- you simply have to play this game for the inclusion of the NES classics alone.")
r9 = Review.create(score: 10, time: 5.months.ago, user_id: u3.id, game_id: g9.id, content: "Super Mario Galaxy is one of the greatest platformers I have ever played, Wii's best game, and an absolute must-own experience. And to me, this odd trek through space really does feel like the true sequel to Mario 64. It harkens back to the N64 classic with nostalgic faces and places from the Mushroom Kingdom, but it also re-invents the franchise with new space-themed mechanics and fresh Wii-enhanced controls. It is, as I have said since I first played it, a near-perfect combination of old platforming values and new design. Expect to be blown away by the fantastic level challenges and galactic variety. Expect to be blown away by the addictive gravity effects -- you will jump off ledges just to see if you can rotate all the way around a structure. And expect to be blown away by the tight controls and beautiful graphics. Galaxy isn't quite perfect. There are some minor issues -- tiny blemishes, if you will, hiding on the backside of a supermodel. There's the auto-camera, which works exceptionally well most of the time, but every so often stumbles. And there's the overall difficulty -- a little too easy to 60 stars and to defeat bosses for my tastes. But even with these potential drawbacks, Nintendo's Tokyo studio has created a platformer that deserves its place among the very best and will surely be remembered in another decade as a classic.")
r10 = Review.create(score: 8, time: 1.months.ago, user_id: u3.id, game_id: g10.id, content: "What really makes Pokemon so great: its little elements expand the experience even after the main game's over. If you've finished the RPG you can still hang about the town collecting the hundreds of creatures and levelling them up for use in local and online battles. Nintendo also ensures that the Pokemon investment will carry over to the console, where the player's collection can be transferred to Wii Pokemon titles like Pokemon Battle Revolution and Pokemon Ranch. I'm reluctant to recommend Pokemon Platinum Version to anyone who's plowed through either Diamond or Pearl in its entirety. Unless, of course, you're completely addicted to the collection element and absolutely must have every creature available. However, for those who haven't jumped into the Pokemon adventure yet, Platinum is the one to back. Even though it's not a huge advancement over Diamond and Pearl, it does have a larger list of features. The single player adventure has a bit more to explore, and more importantly the online component is fleshed out a bit more compared to the 2007 releases.")
r11 = Review.create(score: 9, time: 2.months.ago, user_id: u3.id, game_id: g11.id, content: "Halo is one of the best videogames. There I said it and I'm not going to take it back because Bungie's little DVD of joy will support that claim without any problem. This review is too long as it is and I didn't even mention how well choreographed the real-time event triggers are and the drama of the in-game cinemas. Those are nuggets that I want Xbox owners to discover and appreciate on their own. The hook with Halo is that you can actually do so many things you've always wanted to do in videogames. Being able to run around as a kick ass commando yet still drive vehicles is something I know I've always wanted to do. I wanted to do it in real time without any loading time and without having any part of it, either the vehicle, the enemies or my character looking lame. Not only did Bungie give me that but they threw in awesome sound elements, smarter-than-average bad guys and a gripping storyline all for free.")
r12 = Review.create(score: 9, time: 3.months.ago, user_id: u3.id, game_id: g12.id, content: "Knights of the Old Republic is an outstanding game because it covers every single angle in terms of audience expectations. It's got enough Star Wars to satisfy the fans and enough pure fun to draw in people who normally wouldn't get into role-playing games. You'll see this on several Game of the Year nomination lists if not at the very top soon enough. It grabs you early on by giving your character some cool toys to play with and some familiar Star Wars critters to welcome you back and next thing you know you've got a space ship, a light saber, a wookie and a droid. With Knights of the Old Republic, the galaxy is yours, get out there and get some.")
r13 = Review.create(score: 8, time: 2.months.ago, user_id: u4.id, game_id: g13.id, content: "The team at Treyarch could have played it safe and Black Ops II would have sold well, but instead they challenged assumptions and pushed the series forward in awesome new directions. Itâ€™ll be hard to return to a campaign where I donâ€™t have the ability to shape it, and I simply canâ€™t imagine going back to the old loadout system now that Pick 10 exists. Combined with the host of subtle and overt improvements to the array of other systems, the additions to make it more appealing to Esports, and the more fleshed out Zombies mode, this is not just a fantastic Call of Duty game, but one of the best shooters of the last decade.")
r14 = Review.create(score: 7, time: 2.months.ago, user_id: u4.id, game_id: g14.id, content: "Iâ€™ll always have a massive soft spot for the down under delights of Forza Horizon 3, but open-world racing has never looked as good as it does in Forza Horizon 4. It combines a beautiful world thatâ€™s really four hugely distinct maps in one with a constantly rewarding and self-renewing racing experience and I really canâ€™t tear myself away from it. Playground Games hasnâ€™t just upped the ante once again; itâ€™s blown the bloody doors off.")
r15 = Review.create(score: 8, time: 5.months.ago, user_id: u4.id, game_id: g15.id, content: "Considering the immense hype behind Gears of War, there was a scary potential for it to not live up to expectations. We can happily report that not only has it met these expectations, it has surpassed them. We haven't had this much fun playing a shooter sinceâ€¦ well, we can't quite remember the last time a game was this good. At least not in the scream-into-your-headset, blast-that-bad-dude-in-the-face kind of way that Gears delivers. It's a masterpiece that redefines what 360 gamers, and gamers in general, expect from the next-generation.")
r16 = Review.create(score: 8, time: 3.months.ago, user_id: u4.id, game_id: g16.id, content: "Is the Elder Scrolls IV worth a purchase? Definitely. If you checked the Xbox 360 page, you'll notice it got the same score as this version. If you're an RPG fan, it's an incredible experience. If you regularly beat RPG fans with hockey sticks, you should still try this one out. It's got combat issues, the hotkey system could have been implemented better and some may be ticked off by the environmental loading stutters. Also, keep in mind your loading times aren't going to be seamlessly smooth unless you're playing on a high-end rig. For most gamers with mid-range PCs, you're going to experience hitches. PC gamers get the benefit of the Elder Scrolls IV Construction Set, a big asset for modders looking to expand their Oblivion experience beyond the scope of what Bethesda envisioned. Let it be said, the PC version has advantages. However, because of the PC market's RPG competition, the score remains what the same as Oblivion on the Xbox 360. Despite any criticisms, Oblivion remains a thoroughly enjoyable, user-friendly, gorgeous experience with enough content to keep you returning time and time again.")
r17 = Review.create(score: 7, time: 2.months.ago, user_id: u5.id, game_id: g17.id, content: "Sea of Thieves is a pirate fantasy sandbox with an enormous amount of things to do, made unpredictable and exciting by the addition of other players. Coordinating together across the deck of a massive pirate ship is pure chaos at times, but itâ€™s also endlessly entertaining. The cosmetic-only progression system doesnâ€™t give you as much incentive to keep playing as Iâ€™d have liked and its free-form nature left me feeling lost at sea at times â€“ but if youâ€™ve got a good group of two or three friends to play with, itâ€™s hard to find a game as entertaining to jump aboard.")
r18 = Review.create(score: 6, time: 2.months.ago, user_id: u5.id, game_id: g18.id, content: "Bigger and tougher than it looks, Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautifully realized, brilliantly designed, and at times brutally difficult sylvan Metroidvania-style platformer with enough charm to leave a lasting impression. It's often frustrating and sometimes confusing, but its spectacular platforming, memorable world, and engrossing story wash those concerns away.")

An updated arsenal and great new mobility mechanics give both campaign and multiplayer and modern touch without sacrificing Haloâ€™s classic feel. It fails to introduce its new Spartan characters in a meaningful way, and the story does make some odd logical leaps, but itâ€™s still fast, beautiful, and fun â€“ especially with four-player co-op. Guardiansâ€™ multiplayer harkens back to the Halo 2 glory days with tons of balanced maps and fun modes, and the tactical new Warzone mode absolutely steals the show.")

This iconic series has never really had a misfire, even when changing hands from original developer Epic to The Coalition, and the hot streak remains unbroken. What was unexpected is just how effectively it doubles down on story with a character-focused, consequence-filled tale that plays to one of the franchiseâ€™s most underappreciated strengths and backs it up with fun, welcome additions to both its gameplay formula and flow. And thatâ€™s just the campaign: add in a heavy-hitting multiplayer lineup of Versus, Versus Arcade, Horde, and Escape and it makes Gears 5 one of the best and most versatile action-game packages in recent memory.")

But I didnâ€™t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. Itâ€™s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.")

Thatâ€™s what makes The Last of Us even more impressive, because not only does it join the ranks of Uncharted, Killzone, God of War, Infamous and more, but it bests them all. In short, Naughty Dog has crafted a game that impresses in virtually every way. The Last of Us is a true feat. Its unrivaled presentation in particular sets the bar even higher than the Uncharted trilogy already did, and its writing, voice acting and layered gameplay combine to create what is very easily the game to beat for Game of the Year 2013.")

It earns its spot as a fantastic follow-up, telling a wonderful Miles-specific story while improving upon the fundamentals of the first game with distinctive moves and enemies. And itâ€™s an excellent way to break in your new PlayStation 5; it looks spectacular, loads fast, and makes fun use of the DualSense controller, the directional audio, and more. But regardless of which generation you play it on, itâ€™s a worthy followup to one of the best superhero games ever made.")

Really, you just wanted to know how good it is, and fortunately I can say that it's very, very good. It's easily one of the best games on the system, blending fantastic presentation and visuals with gameplay that is practically second to none. And then there's the stellar multiplayer which you'll probably be playing until Uncharted 3 ships. No, Uncharted 2 is not perfect, but it's closer than pretty much any other game out there these days.")

By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign. A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an all around samurai slashinâ€™ good time.")

Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion.")

This outstanding remaster skillfully enhances those qualities with improved controls, performance, and sheer graphical beauty. It remains one of the best PlayStation games ever made, and itâ€™s wonderful that Sony has brought it back to the fore so a new generation of gamers can experience it without having to look past its aged facade.")
r28 = Review.create(score: 9, time: 1.months.ago , user_id: u7.id, game_id: g28.id, content: "The game as a whole shows some loose ends hanging here and there, things like that Gummi Ship that just don't seem to justify their existence properly. Given the size of this project, though, the number of disparate elements needing to be crammed together, and the huge variety of cooks stirring the soup from both the Square and Disney sides, it's amazing that this has a single end sewn up tight, never mind that it turned into such an engaging adventure. If you like Square, or if you like Disney, or if you'd just like to check out an impressive action-RPG, Kingdom Hearts should be at the top of your list this fall.")

It's got a fantastic soundtrack that's blended incredibly well into the game, a great peripheral in the SG guitar controller and well, that's really what it's all about. The game is just fun. Pure, unadulterated fun, and that's all there is to it. Buy this. Now.")

Players who have been waiting for the next Might & Magic, Ultima, or Wizardry will find that the game's ultra-linear storyline and derivative gameplay offer no new challenges or surprises.")

It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. Itâ€™s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but itâ€™s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas. It is one of the very best video games ever made.")

It sets the standard in all areas, especially the use of physics as a gameplay tool instead of merely a visual treat for gamers. If you're a fan of Half-Life, action games in general, or are looking for a way to get into PC gaming, this is it. It'll hook you, reel you in, and hold you captive for serious hours of hardcore brilliance. This is gaming at its best and shows that the future holds no bounds when the might of technology, precision of design, and touch of artistry work in tandem.")

Go out and get your hands on BioShock -- you will thoroughly enjoy exploring the incredible story and the excellent action that the game is known for. Sure, the full trophy support and Survivor mode are great, and the Challenge Rooms could add a ton to the replayability (whenever it's implemented). However, old glitches that should've been fixed in development hold this game back from being completely realized.")

It had a concise story paired with inventive first-person puzzle mechanics that challenged you to be creative while pulling the trigger. Portal 2 makes the original look like the prototype it was. It's filled with a larger cast of characters vividly brought to life through brilliant writing and some of the best voice acting in video games. Its puzzles are challenging without being unreasonable, and, once you're finished with the single-player mode, one of the best co-operative experiences on the market awaits. Valve cuts no corners and finds ways to make you care about everything from the major characters to the cubes used to solve puzzles. From the beginning of the single-player story to the end of the co-op mode, Portal 2 is a novel, unforgettable experience.")

Skyrim feels twice the size of Oblivion, despite being the same acreage, just because there's so much more to see and do. Searching for Dragon Shouts is a game in itself. Exploring every dungeon is a game in itself. Each one of the six factions is a game in itself. So the fact that the main quest is a mixed bag doesn't hurt Skyrim's huge stock of amazing experiences.")

Itâ€™s distinctive style encourages surprise attacks and frequent use of skill-shot powers, and its colorful art style makes everything pop on the screen. Learning how to make the most of its characters and to become an asset to a team is a long and challenging process, but once youâ€™ve got it down, itâ€™s incredibly satisfying to work together to destroy your enemies in this amazing MOBA.")

And at max level, this is probably the most compelling World of Warcraft's beckoning call to stick around has ever been, mainly because of Torghast and the chances it presents you to craft your own legendary items. But the fact remains that max-level play is designed to keep you around as long as possible with a limited amount of drip-fed story and repetitive daily and weekly activities, even if Shadowlands has more of them, and they're more fun, than any previous expansion. Don't get me wrong: this one ranks highly in the pantheon, up there with Legion and Wrath of the Lich King, partly because it makes some honest and substantial attempts to reinvent the tired endgame formula. I'm just still not sure if it goes far enough to hold my interest, and subscription dollars, in between the meatier story drops in major patches.")

With its powerful artistic style and blazingly quick, yet accessible gameplay, it's enough to melt the icy cynicism imprisoning the hearts of even the most jaded among us. That being said, it's not the most complex shooter out there, and lacks bot support for now. Still, the game's got enough to it to last for a long while, and there's a statistics system built into Steam to help keep track of everything. Buy it, load it up and let loose. It's near-impossible to be disappointed.")

The flexibility of its magically-infused cast paired with a deep arsenal makes for a magnificent competitive canvas, if a tricky one to initially pick up. I'm already pondering new strategies to pull off with my friends in the future, and that joyous daydreaming won't stop anytime soon. It may not be the prettiest modern FPS around, but its visual simplicity enables excellent clarity in every fight. With its teeth sunk in this deep, Valorant makes me want to keep playing until there's nothing left to master.")
